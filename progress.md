2026-11-03 setup: created isolated worktree D:\PADIEM\mcp-shell-261103 from origin/main 2c4465e0f on feat/mcp-pc-shell-261103.
2026-11-03 research: traced MCP tools/list -> transport -> dispatch/approval -> execution -> Chat oracle_mesh command lane -> Connector MeshCentral run_command; read result size, timeout, audit and existing pc_* implementations.
2026-11-03 research: inspected DesktopCommanderMCP (MIT) terminal-manager and process-tree design (wait cap, bounded output, paginated read, force_terminate); no source copied.
2026-11-03 implementation: added pc_shell closed schema (command/cwd/shell/timeout_seconds), Base64 one-line dispatch worker for powershell/cmd/bash, separate stdout/stderr, exit-code capture, 12KB head/tail truncation, 1-600s limit with process-tree termination.
2026-11-03 implementation: reused MCP _tool registration, owner/device/grant checks, dispatch approval/audit, oracle_mesh command dispatch and result store; added numeric audit metadata and migration 094.
2026-11-03 tests: added 16 pc_shell tests (schema, delegation/disconnect denial, completed/timeout/truncation/error, audit privacy, Windows PowerShell/cmd/bash worker); fixed Windows cp949 test-environment reads and child PYTHONIOENCODING.
2026-11-03 verify: MCP suite 129 passed; help guide tests 19 passed; no production writes, no deploy, no PR.
2026-11-03 docs: added architecture replacement memo, help.html MCP connection section, updated MCP gateway handoff doc.
