2026-11-03 setup: created isolated worktree D:\PADIEM\mcp-shell-261103 from origin/main 2c4465e0f on feat/mcp-pc-shell-261103.
2026-11-03 research: traced MCP tools/list -> transport -> dispatch/approval -> execution -> Chat oracle_mesh command lane -> Connector MeshCentral run_command; read result size, timeout, audit and existing pc_* implementations.
2026-11-03 research: inspected DesktopCommanderMCP (MIT) terminal-manager and process-tree design (wait cap, bounded output, paginated read, force_terminate); no source copied.
2026-11-03 implementation: added pc_shell closed schema (command/cwd/shell/timeout_seconds), Base64 one-line dispatch worker for powershell/cmd/bash, separate stdout/stderr, exit-code capture, 12KB head/tail truncation, 1-600s limit with process-tree termination.
2026-11-03 implementation: reused MCP _tool registration, owner/device/grant checks, dispatch approval/audit, oracle_mesh command dispatch and result store; added numeric audit metadata and migration 094.
2026-11-03 tests: added 16 pc_shell tests (schema, delegation/disconnect denial, completed/timeout/truncation/error, audit privacy, Windows PowerShell/cmd/bash worker); fixed Windows cp949 test-environment reads and child PYTHONIOENCODING.
2026-11-03 verify: MCP suite 129 passed; help guide tests 19 passed; no production writes, no deploy, no PR.
2026-11-03 docs: added architecture replacement memo, help.html MCP connection section, updated MCP gateway handoff doc.
2026-11-03 setup: created isolated worktree from origin/main d123d14c8accf232d52bc0d4e813574bdbf5a6b7 on feat/6724-scenario-sim-261103.
2026-11-03 read: fetched #6724; read CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AI_DEVELOPMENT_OPERATING_POLICY.md and TEST_SCOPE_AND_DELIVERY_POLICY.md; private Governance NOT_READ per machine constraint and supplied work order.
2026-11-03 docs: added six evidence-based scenario scripts and README; browser screens/copy checked in Chat and BookAI sources.
2026-11-03 runner: added live Playwright recording fixture with step screenshots, timing/status metadata, video, and account-state gating; public tests will use GET-only route guard.
2026-11-03 implementation: added guest GET-only browser scenarios, storage-state-gated first-question/PC/document/BookAI cases, tutorial storyboard generator, manual workflow_dispatch-only workflow, and isolated backup restore smoke script.
2026-11-03 resume: confirmed branch/worktree and prior artifacts; no new folder; no session or cookie stored.
2026-11-03 bookai: finished second-device resume step with a fresh browser profile, BookAI session check (skip test_account_missing), account sync assertion, TODAY/continue UI check, and second-device video artifact.
2026-11-03 docs: aligned 01/04 screenplay rows and caption mapping with the actual TODAY/continue flow; root live-artifacts is ignored.
2026-11-03 verify: guest live scenario passed on production GET-only; 5 account cases skipped; tutorial builder test passed; local browser regression 41 passed and 3 pre-existing admin-model icon-count failures reproduced unchanged.
2026-11-03 commit: docs 5f59d0bcc, runner/tutorial aee323d00; workflow and this log follow before fetch/rebase/push.
2026-11-03 ci-fix: (컴1로컬1 대행) live-scenarios 잡에 uv 부트스트랩·pinned Playwright·chromium 단계를 추가한다. cross_lane_test_dependency_guard가 잡은 MISSING_FIRST_PARTY_ROOT=padiem_control_plane·MISSING_THIRD_PARTY_DEP=starlette 2건이 로컬에서 11 passed로 풀렸고 guard는 PASS.
2026-11-03 setup: created isolated worktree D:\PADIEM\mcp-oauth-261103 from origin/main ad069bdf9 on feat/mcp-oauth-261103.
2026-11-03 research: read the pc_shell design memo, AUTH_STANDARD, existing MCP Bearer transport/account/store; confirmed MCP Authorization 2026-07-28 and Claude/ChatGPT connector requirements.
2026-11-03 decision: (a) Chat hosts MCP-specific OAuth endpoints using the existing Chat common login session; padiem-auth keys/clients untouched.
2026-11-03 implementation: added PRM/AS metadata, DCR, PKCE authorize + consent info/POST, code/token/refresh/revoke, 401 resource_metadata challenge, resource/scope audience checks; PAT path preserved.
2026-11-03 storage: migration 095 extends padiem_mcp_tokens (kind/expiry/refresh/client/scope/resource) and adds oauth_clients/oauth_codes; account deletion/purge updated.
2026-11-03 login/UI: added same-origin login-return cookie to shared login, consent page HTML/CSS/JS, ko/en locale keys, help.html web-connection guidance.
2026-11-03 tests: 12 OAuth tests plus 223 broad MCP/login/deletion/purge/help regression passed on this machine; no production writes/deploy/PR.
2026-11-03 docs: OAuth section 11 added to the replacement memo, operations handoff note updated, progress log created.
2026-11-03 front-audit: mapped every OAuth path through apps/padiem-chat-front worker.mjs; the static branch only matches "/" + root single-segment asset files + /static/, so /.well-known/oauth-*, /oauth/* and /api/mcp already reach COM2, but OAuth GET/POST/OPTIONS only got the 8s generic deadline (apiRead covers /api/ paths).
2026-11-03 front-change: added an oauthRequest predicate (/oauth/ and /.well-known/oauth- prefixes) that bypasses the static/cache branch and reuses API_READ_TIMEOUT_MS (30s); other /.well-known paths and consent static assets unchanged; no new wrangler vars.
2026-11-03 front-tests: new test/mcp-oauth-paths.test.mjs (7 tests: per-path COM2 target, no-store, POST body, 302 + login-return cookie pass-through, OPTIONS, timeout budget, jwks not broadened, consent asset still cached); full front suite 65 passed. Memo section 11.7/11.8 updated with the front redeploy item.
